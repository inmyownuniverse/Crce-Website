                  Greetings and a very warm welcome to CRCE!

                  I have great pleasure in expressing my thoughts as the
                  Principal of Fr. Conceicao Rodriuges College of Engineering: a
                  prestigious, self-financed institute affiliated to University
                  of Mumbai, Maharashtra and approved by AICTE. Fr CRCE was
                  established in 1984 with a vision of Moulding Engineers who
                  can Build the Nation inspired by the dream of our founder Rev.
                  Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4 font-roboto leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                  Fr. CRCE aspires to be a center of excellence in engineering
                  education, moulding engineers with the state-of-the art
                  technologies, innovative skills and human values matching with
                  the growing expectations of the corporates and the society and
                  thus play an effective role in nation building.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 font-roboto leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                  Education makes one more well-informed and knowledgeable. Both
                  of these will help to enhance critical thinking skills needed
                  to make good decisions in every walk of life. Education must
                  prepare aspiring minds for Marathon and make them Life-Long
                  Learner.
